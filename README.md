### Background
This project aims to implement a tool to visualize the evolution of pyramid building during the Pyramid Age (2700â€“1700 BCE). By showing novel visualizations about pyramids, and allowing the user to customize various parameters, it seeks to offer an updated and broader understanding of societal development during this period, addressing the gaps and omissions of past visualizations that have predominantly focused on linear interpretations centered on kings and the structural characteristics of the pyramids. This initiative will generate new charts and infographics for inclusion in an academic publication, providing a comprehensive overview of the development of funerary constructions and their significance through time.

### Goal
- Generate plots related to the status, length of rule, gender (including kings, queens, and other individuals) of pyramid complexes through time and space
- Create updated images based on the ones in `assets/`, which are from 1997. The current images focus exclusively on the pyramids of kings, and they miss other significant developments, such as the expansion of the mortuary temples, areas for decoration, and the evolution of miniature pyramid complexes for queens, among others.
- Combine charts, plots, and information into an infographic that tells a story

### Questions

- How linear is the development of pyramid construction, and to what extent does it reflect the rise and fall of the Pyramid Age?

- How do visual representations, such as those in the `assets/` folder in this repository, influence our perception of these monuments, their development, and the surrounding social context?
